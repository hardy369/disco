A lightweight implementation of Noise induced Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) using noise as a computational resource. This project explores the use of quantum decoherence and noise to enhance or regulate the computational dynamics of quantum reservoirs in temporal learning tasks.

** Overview**

Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) is a hybrid quantum-classical framework that leverages the complex dynamics of quantum systems for machine learning tasks, especially those 
involving temporal patterns. In this implementation, we:

This script implements the parallel spatial multiplexing architecture, configured for a large-scale(50,000) benchmark test.

Simulate a quantum reservoir composed of complex quantum circuit with different kinds of qubit entanglement.

Introduce and control various types of quantum noise (e.g., depolarizing, amplitude damping, phase noise).

Demonstrate the utility of noisy quantum reservoirs in temporal tasks such as memory capacity and nonlinear autoregressive moving average (NARMA) prediction( Benchmark for reservoir computing).
